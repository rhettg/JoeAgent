JoeAgent - A Multi-Agent Distributed Application Framework
March 2004

This framework was developed as a senior project by Rhett
Garber at California Polytechnique University, San Luis
Obispo. As of the time of this writing, there really isn't a
true application using this framework. 

For an example application using this framework, check out
JoeTraffic. You should be able to get it from wherever you
found this framework.  JoeTraffic is a web-log analysis
application. It is far from complete or useful.

This framework is being released under the GNU Lesser Public
License. As I understand I have full rights to be able to do
that, even though this was developed as a senior project for
Cal Poly.
